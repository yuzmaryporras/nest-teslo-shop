# 🔴 Teslo API - Learning NestJS + Docker + MongoDB

This project is an API built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) to learn how to build modular and scalable REST APIs while integrating tools like Docker and Postgres.

---

## 📚 Objective

To progressively learn NestJS by building a API called "Teslo", practicing the use of Docker, Postgres Database, DTOs, TypeORM and best practices in API development

---


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **NestJS**
- **TypeScript**
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**
- **Postgres**
- **TypeORM**
- **ESLint + Prettier**

  ``` 


## 📬 Postman Collection

All available API requests are included in a Postman collection so you can test them easily.

📁 File path:

```bash
postman/teslo-shop.postman_collection.json
```

You can import this file into Postman to test endpoints like:

```bash
GET /product/:term

GET /product/?limit=5&offset=10 - Pagination

POST /product

PATCH /product/:term

DELETE /product/:id
